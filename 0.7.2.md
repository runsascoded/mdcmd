v0.7.2: Error handling improvements

🐛 Bug fixes
- Fix `mdcmd` to exit with non-zero code when embedded commands fail
- Commands that fail no longer crash with stack traces
- Failed commands are reported gracefully with exit code and output
- Other commands continue to execute in concurrent mode

📦 Dependencies
- Bump `utz` requirement to `>=0.21.1` (includes fix for `text()` handling `None`)

🧪 Tests
- Add tests for command failure handling
- Add tests for mixed success/failure scenarios
- Add tests to ensure no uncaught exceptions on errors

This release fixes a critical issue where `mdcmd` would exit with code 0 even when commands failed, breaking shell scripts using `set -e`.
