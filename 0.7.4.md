v0.7.4: New `-r/--exit-code` option for `bmd`

✨ New features
- Add `-r/--exit-code` option to `bmd` for expected non-zero exit codes
- Useful for commands like `diff` that exit 1 on differences (expected behavior, not an error)
- When set, `bmd` exits 0 if the command exits with the expected code, 1 otherwise
